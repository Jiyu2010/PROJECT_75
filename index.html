      <p>Students who attend school regularly have been shown to achieve at higher levels than students who do not have regular attendance. This relationship between attendance and achievement may appear early in a child's school career.School attendance means the physical presence of a Child and/or Children within regular school hours and includes attending scheduled classes during scheduled hours for any particular student.Why is it important for students to attend school?
        Not only will you learn subjects but you will also learn new skills, including social skills. The skills and knowledge that you learn at school will help you now and in later life as you start work. Good attendance shows potential employers that you are reliable.</p>
